# Rishav Chaudhary's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I showcase my journey as a budding software developer and data scientist, featuring projects that highlight my skills and passion for technology.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
   - **Usage**: These core web technologies were used to build the static pages of my portfolio. HTML provided the structure, CSS was utilized for styling, and JavaScript added interactivity to the webpages.
   - **Examples**:
     - Styled the header, navigation, and sections using CSS Flexbox and Grid for responsive and modern layouts.
     - Implemented JavaScript-based interactivity, such as smooth scrolling for navigation links and form validation in the contact section.

### DOM needs to be reviewed and address the form validation
Right now, just a raw format.
